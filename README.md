#Cloud Gardens# 
Very chill, you balance between creating plants which grow around the environment and placing trash in the environment which allows the plants to grow. Beautiful low poly models with pixelart texturing. A good game to relax to. I (Maxi) would argue that this game could serve as a tool for practicing environment design.

#Hoplegs#
